Why use Trees?
    - You can search, and insert / delete items quickly in a Tree
    - Ordered Arrays are bad at Insetions / Deletions
    - Finding items in a Linked List is slow
    - Time needed to preform an operation on a tree is O(log N)
    - On average a tree is more efficient if you need to preform many different types of operations
